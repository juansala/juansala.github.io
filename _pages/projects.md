# Vision-based Autonomy for a Quadruped Robot

<p><img class="profile" align="right" src="https://juansala.github.io/media/Images/pupper.jpg" alt="pupper" /></p>

Developing a ROS2 software stack to perform control, localization, and mapping on the open-source [Stanford Pupper](https://github.com/stanfordroboticsclub/StanfordQuadruped) quadruped robot. The goal of this project is to re-enforce my robot autonomy fundamentals and to further hone my C++ skills.

# Leader-follower Coordination of Soft Robotic Fish

<p><img class="profile" align="right" src="https://juansala.github.io/media/Images/sofi_diagram.png" alt="fish_diagram" /></p>

A vision-based coordination strategy for autonomous, untethered soft robotic fish that I worked on for my graduate research project. Implemented as an autonomy stack that consists of underwater target image processing, high-level behavior control, and a visual-servoing controller for actuation of the tail. Presented and [published](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9965882) at the 2022 IEEE OES AUV Symposium.

# Hexapod Gazebo Simulation

<p><img class="profile" align="right" src="https://juansala.github.io/media/Images/worms_hex_sim.png" alt="worms_hexapod" /></p>

A ROS/Gazebo simulation for a hexapod robot designed for locomotion over lunar terrain. Developed to verify continually evolving system architecture for submission to NASA BIG Idea Challenge 2022.

# Ring Watch

<p><img class="profile" align="right" src="https://juansala.github.io/media/Images/ring_watch_topview.png" alt="ring_watch" /></p>

A silly watch that tells you the time via a single RGB LED ...and fits on your ring finger! Based on the ATtiny85 and PCF8523 real time clock.
