I graduated from MIT with a double S.B. in Aerospace Engineering (with a concentration in Autonomous Systems) and Electrical Engineering as well as an MEng in EECS. I am passionate about building the next generation of autonomous systems that will help answer questions about life beyond Earth. I currently work on the hardware and software development of SoFi, an autonomous robotic fish that propels itself with a soft silicone elastomer tail.

Recently, my team and I implemented a basic leader-follower scheme with 2 SoFis via visual tracking. Check out this video of some of our earlier results below:
