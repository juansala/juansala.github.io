# About Me


<img align="right" src="https://juansala.github.io/media/Images/leeb-copy.jpg" alt="Me" width="671" height="894">

I graduated from MIT with a double S.B. in Aerospace Engineering (concentration in Autonomous Systems) and Electrical Engineering as well as an MEng in EECS. I am passionate about building the next generation of autonomous systems that will help answer questions about life beyond Earth. I am currently working as a Robotics Analyst for the ISS program at NASA Johnson Space Center.
