# About Me

<p><img class="profile" align="right" src="https://juansala.github.io/media/Images/leeb-copy.jpg" alt="Me" style="width:45%" /></p>

I graduated from MIT with a double S.B. in Aerospace Engineering (concentration in Autonomous Systems) and Electrical Engineering as well as an MEng in EECS. I am passionate about building the next generation of autonomous systems that will help answer questions about life beyond Earth. 

Currently, I work as a Robotics Analyst for the ISS program at NASA Johnson Space Center.

# Latest Work

For my graduate research (2022), I worked on an autonomous visual-based leader-follower behavior for a robotic fish platform. Check out this video of some of our results below:
